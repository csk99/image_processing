# Image processing using python

## Project Intro
This repository contains a set of notebooks about various images processing methods I have been learning about in Python.
I have been learning about the subject because I was attending classed about in my previous school lectures and I was also preparing for the [Huawei ICT Artificial Intelligence Professional Certificate](https://e.huawei.com/en/talent/#/cert/product-details?certifiedProductId=275&authenticationLevel=CTYPE_CARE_HCIP&technicalField=BSH&version=2.0)

Various image manipulation techniques are being used, including:

* image ehancement methods (gamma correction, noise removal ..etc)
* image arithmetic operations 
* image spectral transformations
* etc.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
    
2. Create a virtual environment in the project folder (for help see this [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)).

3. Run the following command to install the necessary packages.
* For linux users:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
* For windows users:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Open the Notebook file and choose the virtual environment created above
